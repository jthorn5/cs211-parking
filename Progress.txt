We have created a programmatic way to interface with the Maps API to find the closest parking lot to a given location, which has been put in a wrapper class (Route) for convenience and usability. We have gathered real parking lot data from George Mason's Parking Services so we can use accurate numbers of parking spaces and account for all appropriate parking lots and decks. We have created the object-oriented structure by which the parking locations, their spaces, and the spaces' car info can be stored.

This program will allow a user to select a location and be recommended the closest available parking lot to it. It will be able to track every parking space in every Parking Location (comprised of Parking Lots and Parking Decks) and store either information about the vehicle/driver inhabiting it or its availability, and to what group it may be restricted.

We will next be doing work which includes integrating the pieces of code with each other so they function as a single cohesive program, create a means to read in the config (parking data) file, create a means for the user to interface with the program, and the ability to fill spaces with random cars to simulate use.
